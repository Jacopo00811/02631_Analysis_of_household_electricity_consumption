# 02631_Analysis_of_household_electricity_consumption
Project for the course 02631 Introduction to programming and data processing (Fall 21) at DTU. It is a program for analysis and visualization of household electricity consumption, libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib have been used. The full description can be found in the PDF file provided.

Side note:
This was my first ever project in Python so the optimization is not the best, therefore it might take some time to run and produce graphs.
